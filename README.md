# Steam-Game-Data-Analysis

I came across this post in the r/datasets subreddit where the user u/Rokanov has posted a data set that he had downloaded from the Steam and SteamSpy APIs. It includes release data, developers, publisher, genres, positive/negative ratings, average/medium, playtime, number of owners, price, descriptions media data (e.g. screenshots), system requirements, and support info (company url and email).

You can find the dataset under the user's Kaggle page here:

I am avid gamer and Steam is the main platform that I play on and I have always been curious to explore a dataset on Steam. Thanks to u/Rokanov aka Nik Davis, he has compiled an impressive data set that I can't wait to explore deeper.
